# Backend template
Parfurance backend tamplate can be used in backend projects to speed up the development process.
It is a simple and easy to use template that can be used in any backend project.
It is built using Typescript and Express.js. Cames with pre defined eslint and prettier configs.
## Usage
To use this template, you can simply clone this repository and start building your project on top of it.

# Warning

this shit not working right now you need to clone project and change it manually.
The evil fucking company named gitlab makes everything every fucking thing for ultimate fucking 30 dollar edition.
So we cannot use simple fucking template repository.
Thx to who makes this fucking pricing system fuck you gitlab peace out.
